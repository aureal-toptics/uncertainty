# Game of Life firmware

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life made for the Eurorack module [Uncertainty](https://oamodular.org/products/uncertainty).  

Coded in CircuitPython using ChatGPT.

In future I'll be adding to this Readme to explain more, but for now: send a clock pulse into Uncertainty, modulate its level to seed the grid. Enjoy evolving gates. 

For some reason it take a few cycles to get started.

This video explains how to get CircuitPython scripts working on Uncertainty: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxiUihIq3_Y
