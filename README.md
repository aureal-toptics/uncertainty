# Uncertainty firmwares

## What are they

These are various firmwares for [Uncertainty](https://oamodular.org/products/uncertainty), an open source programmable Eurorack module made by Olivia Artz Modular. Uncertainty has one analogue input and 8 digital outputs, and is based around the RP2040 microcontroller. 

These firmwares are mainly gate processors or generators for creating non-conventional CV gate or trigger patterns.

I made them in [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/board/seeeduino_xiao_rp2040/) using ChatGPT. It's surprisingly easy. You should try it.

## How to use them
